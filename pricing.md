This structure provides a very affordable entry point at $5 while maintaining good margins. The free tier serves as a trial, and the pricing tiers scale reasonably as users need more credits and features.

You would need about 7-8 users on the Business plan (or equivalent revenue from mixed plans) to cover your Supabase fixed costs, with additional users contributing directly to profit.
